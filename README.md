## Motivation
There is a general idea that the earlier we book the flight, the lower be the ticket prices. But the question is, whenever anyone plans to book the flight, how one could know which flight would be cheaper.  Moreover, the price of a flight ticket is highly dependent upon demand and changes accordingly. In this project, I am trying to solve this issue with the help of data science.
## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to create a web app that could help the users to get an estimate of the Indian flight ticket prices, given the details about the flights such as source, destination, departure/arrival date and time, etc.
## Data Collection
The dataset has been taken from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/nikhilmittal/flight-fare-prediction-mh?select=Data_Train.xlsx. The dataset contains the prices of flight tickets for various airlines between the months of March and June of 2019 and between various cities.
