## Motivation
There is a general idea that the earlier we book the flight, the lower be the ticket prices. But the question is, whenever anyone plans to book the flight, how one could know which flight would be cheaper.  Moreover, the price of a flight ticket is highly dependent upon demand and changes accordingly. In this project, I am trying to solve this issue with the help of data science.
## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to create a web app that could help the users to get an estimate of the Indian flight ticket prices, given the details about the flights such as source, destination, departure/arrival date and time, etc.
## Data Collection
The dataset has been taken from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/nikhilmittal/flight-fare-prediction-mh?select=Data_Train.xlsx. It contains the data about prices of flight tickets for various airlines and between various cities for the period between the months of March and June of 2019. Here is the details about data:-

Size of training set: 10683 records<br>
Size of test set: 2671 records

**FEATURES**: <br>
Airline: The name of the airline.<br>
Date_of_Journey: The date of the journey.<br>
Source: The source from which the service begins.<br>
Destination: The destination where the service ends.<br>
Route: The route taken by the flight to reach the destination.<br>
Dep_Time: The time when the journey starts from the source.<br>
Arrival_Time: Time of arrival at the destination.<br>
Duration: Total duration of the flight.<br>
Total_Stops: Total stops between the source and destination.<br>
Additional_Info: Additional information about the flight.<br>
Price: The price of the ticket.<br>
