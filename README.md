## Data Collection
The dataset used is available on kaggle. The dataset contained information like source,destination,departure date and time,arrival date and time , stops and price as target variable and data preprocessing was required to convert this data to numerical digits and breaking of certain features like date to month and day , time to hours and minutes and one hot encoding for sourse and destinations.
